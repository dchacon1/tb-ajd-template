## Overview
This folder contains the version 1 template used to create Advanced Job Detail pages on TalentBrew.


## Introduction
The AJD template is meant to be a skeleton version of HTML and SASS. This has been done to speed up the development of AJDs. **All HTML goes inside one job details module.**


## Technologies used
* HTML5: Used for the structure and layout
* SCSS: Used for styling
* ASP.net Razor: used to link dynamic content from system
* BEM: Is a class naming structure of Block__Element--Modifier it helps you to achieve reusable components and code and it makes CSS specificity very flat and low reducing the need for `!important` declarations.
* jQuery: Used for animations and different functionality. There is an AJD script and a Custom Imports Script being used


## What this template works with
ALL HTML and Razor works in the TB system with the latest features of the TB Job Details page. The SASS variables, mixins and functions work with the default SASS and Compass for TB Full Theme



## Instructions for creating the first AJD on a site
1. Begin by **creating a new Theme** inside the current TB site.
    * Name this theme [custom theme name (Normally category and or location or Job title)]
2. Edit the new theme HTML and Razor
    1. Copy all the HTML and Razor from the Default "Full" Theme to this new theme
    2. Make sure the SASS and JavaScript that are assigned to the new theme matches the "Full" Theme
    4. Add `<script src="https://clientfiles.tmpwebeng.com/tmp/tb-assets/ajd/jquery-scrolltofixed-min.js"></script>` then `<script src="https://clientfiles.tmpwebeng.com/tmp/tb-assets/ajd/ajd-scripts-min.js"></script>` under `@Html.Partial("_ThemeJavascript")` (Both files are needed and work together to add functionality to the AJD. The first script is for the sticky header and the second has the JS calling the first and has other AJD functions )
    5. Add `<script id="js-custom-imports" src="https://services1.tmpwebeng.com/custom-imports/custom-imports.js?scripts=charts,video"></script>` under `@Html.Partial("_ThemeJavascript")` (This file is the Decoupled Scripts file, we will slowly be moving all AJD features to this file.)
3. Add Template SASS to the full theme SASS
    * Add the [AJD template SASS](https://github.com/radancyco/tb-ajd-template/blob/main/code/ajd-styles.scss) to the full theme sass and edit it to match your mocks
4. Create the page in the theme
    1. Within your new Theme **create a new Advanced Job Details page.** name it "AJD – [current custom theme name]"
    2. Add any core or shell level modules you need to match the new page to the existing Default theme. You can compare the Default Theme Job Details page to your new one to see what modules you need to add to which partials and use that the base your new page off of. Note that your new page may not have all of the modules the current Default Job Details page has and that some of the modules may need to be shifted in placement or styled differently within your new theme page.
5. **Create a new Job Details module** from the Modules page and name it "AJD – [current custom theme name]"
    * Inside of the newly created Job Details Module you will replace all of the HTML/razor that is currently there with the [AJD template HTML](https://github.com/radancyco/tb-ajd-template/blob/main/code/ajd-module.html)
6. In your new AJD named Job Details page go to the partial assignment where the default Job Details Module is and click on the dropdown arrow and choose to replace the default Job Details Module with your newly created module. (If you do not see your module in the dropdown first make sure the module has been saved and refresh the job details page)
7. Go to any modules that are also in the AJD in page navigation for example the Callout Link Module for the Map and add the class `ajd_section` to the module and add an id of "anchor-[section name]" so for that map module it would be `id="anchor-map"` Also at the bottom of the module add an accessibility link to get back into the navigation for the map module it would be `<p class="back-to-ajd-nav"><a class="back-to-ajd-nav__a" href="#ajd-anchor-map">Back to Job Navigation (Map)</a></p>`


## Visual Examples
* [Developer - Skeleton Example](https://radancy.dev/tb-ajd-template/examples/skeleton/) This example shows what an AJD would look like if you made one only using the default styles of a Full TB, with alerts that remind the developer to update links.
* [Creative - Skeleton Example](https://radancy.dev/tb-ajd-template/examples/skeleton/?no-checks) This example shows what an AJD would look like if you made one only using the default styles of a Full TB, without alerts.


## Instructions for creating an additional AJD after one already exists on a site
1. Use the copy function on the theme level of a previously made AJD
2. Copy the current Job Details module that was used on the previous AJD THeme
3. Assign that new module to the new theme in place of the previous Job Details Module.
4. Updating the content on that new Job Details Module as needed



## Understanding what you can do and change

### Add unique SVG images
1. Save your illustration as an SVG
2. Compress your SVG https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ (Make sure 'remove ViewBox' is disabled but 'Prefer viewBox to width/height' is enabled)
3. Change the stroke color to `REPLACEME`
4. Encode SVG for background image http://codepen.io/jakob-e/pen/doMoML
5. Search for `REPLACEME` and replace it with `#{$icon-color}`
6. Then you place that background image css into the following code and of course give it a name
```
@mixin ico-[your icon name here]($icon-color:#000) {
    $icon-color: svg-color-replace("#{$icon-color}"); //this function changes the color to svg compatible format
    [Your Background image css here]
}
```
7. Then you can call that SVG wherever you want like this
```
.class {
    @include ico-test(#ccc);
}
```

### Add or remove sticky functionality
All you need to do for this is to add or remove the class `js-ajd-sticky` which is by default on the `id="ajd_header"`. You can move this class to any element you want but it should only be used once on the page.


### Account for a client nav that is also sticky
Add the class `js-ajd-also-sticky` to the nav element that is sticky


### Add or remove animations on scroll or change how often animations happen
add `enhance-element` class to any elements you want to enhacne when they come into view of the viewport. When this element comes into view two classes will be added `active` and `actived-once` when this elment goes out of view the class `active` is removed but `actived-once` remains. So when you want to only animate something once then you put your css animations of the `actived-once` class. This may be ideal for the rwards icons to only animate on the first time you see them and not animate again when you scroll past them and then back up again.


### Make in page navigation highlight only one section at a time
In order to do this all you have to do is look for the class `ajd_navigation` in the HTML and add a class to that same div called `singular-highlighting`


### Adjusting the scroll to offset when using the in page navigation
Ideally, AJD sections should use Padding to offset where the sticky nav will stop. It always stops at the top of the section, so padding helps adds space between where the bottom of the nav is and the content of the section is, for example the headline. If you have overlap, check to see if there is a client nav that is being used in addtion to the AJD nav and use the `js-ajd-also-sticky` class on the client nav. If you still have issues or if padding will affect the design of the section you can use `data-ajd-offset-scroll` on the section. For example `data-ajd-offset-scroll="-20"` will remove 20px from the offset. (please note: that data-ajd-offset-scroll can not change from breakpoint to breakpoint. So you add 30 to the offset it will be 30px on both mobile and desktop)


### Updating Glassdoor to match company
1. Search for the companies glassdoor review page [here](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)
2. Then click on the company name in the results list
3. Click on the reviews tab
4. use the URL in the browser, for example TMP's is https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TMP-Worldwide-Reviews-E247764.htm
5. Find the anchor tag for glassdoor and replace `#REPLACEME` with the url
6. Copy the numbers in the URL that trail the E, for example TMP's is 247764
7. Find the AJD Glassdoor image source located in the CSS as a background image and replace the `01` after the `?e=` with the copied numbers


### Adding a video to the banner
1. Make sure that your Custom Imports script has video as a script it is loading
    * It will load in Fancybox script and styles by default, if you are already loading fancybox and want to use your own styles you can turn those off by adding `&no-styles=video&no-dependencies=video` to the script src
2. Add the following code to your banner and edit as needed
```
<button
   class="js-ci-video ci-video-btn"
   data-fancybox=""
   data-src="#ajd-video"
   data-video-name="ajdvideo"
   data-caption="<button data-fancybox href='#hidden-ajd-video-transcript'>Transcript</button>"
   aria-label="Now Hiring REPLACEMEajdMappingName (Video)">
</button>

<video id="ajd-video" aria-label="REPLACEMEajdMappingName" style="display:none;" controls crossorigin="anonymous">
   <source src="url/ajd-REPLACEMEajdMappingName.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <track label="English" kind="captions" srclang="en" src="url/ajd-REPLACEMEajdMappingName-caption-en.vtt">
</video>

<div style="display: none;" id="hidden-ajd-video-transcript">
   <!-- Transcript (Taken from VTT, formatted into HTML) -->
